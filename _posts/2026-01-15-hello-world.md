Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm David, and this is where I'll be sharing my thoughts on travel, technology, and everything in between.

## Why Start a Blog?

I've always believed that the best way to learn is by sharing. Whether it's a hidden gem I discovered in Southeast Asia or a productivity hack that changed my workflow, I want to document these experiences—not just for others, but for my future self.

## What to Expect

Here's what you'll find on this blog:

- **Travel Stories** - From bustling cities to remote beaches, I'll share my adventures and practical tips
- **Tech Insights** - Thoughts on the tools and technologies I use daily
- **Life Lessons** - Reflections on balancing work, travel, and personal growth

## Let's Connect

I'd love to hear from you! Feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:hello@davidtan.me) or connect with me on social media.

Here's to new adventures and shared stories.

*— David*
